## Scripts and data used to perform molecular dating with the FBD model.  
Scripts mainly written by S. Ramirez-Barahona.  
Data and input files compiled by S. Bellot.  

"Data" contains the input data (ages) on fossil and extant taxa included in the tree.  
"scripts_old" were used to perform the molecular dating following the "older ages" strategy.  
"scripts_young" were used to perform the molecular dating following the "younger ages" strategy.  
This enabled us to explore the use of different root prior ages on the divergence time estimates. See the article for details.
